A bare bones tracker for Magic: The Gathering. I found myself using the calculator app to avoid the annoyance of other trackers, so I made this.

Features Include:
* Free with no ads
* Open source
* An adjustable number of players
* Roll a D6, or D20
* Choose a player at random (Great for choosing who goes first!)
